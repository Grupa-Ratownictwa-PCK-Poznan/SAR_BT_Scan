# SAR BT+WiFi Scanner - User Guide

## What Is This?

SAR BT Scanner is a portable device detection system designed for **Search and Rescue (SAR) operations**. It detects wireless signals from phones, smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other Bluetooth/WiFi devices that a missing person might be carrying.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Detects Bluetooth devices within ~50-100 meters
- Captures WiFi probe requests from phones searching for known networks
- Tags all detections with GPS coordinates and timestamps
- Helps differentiate between SAR team equipment and potential target devices

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Power On

Connect your scanner to power. The system will automatically:
- Initialize GPS and wait for satellite fix
- Start scanning for Bluetooth and WiFi devices
- Launch the web dashboard

### 2. Wait for GPS Fix

Before moving into the search area, ensure the GPS indicator shows a fix:
- **3D Fix** (green) - Optimal, full coordinates with altitude
- **2D Fix** (yellow) - Acceptable, no altitude data
- **NO FIX** (red) - Wait for satellites, GPS data will be missing

### 3. Access the Dashboard

On any device connected to the same network, open a web browser and go to:

```
http://<scanner-ip>:8000
```

The IP address is typically shown on the scanner's display or can be found via your router.

## Web Dashboard Overview

### Status Panel (Top)

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **GPS** | Satellite fix status and count |
| **Mode** | Current scan mode (BT/WiFi/Both) |
| **WiFi Mon** | WiFi monitor mode active (ON/OFF) |
| **Time** | Current UTC time |

### Data Tabs

| Tab | Content |
|-----|--------|
| **BT Devices** | Unique Bluetooth devices detected with manufacturer and notes |
| **BT Sightings** | Individual detection events with RSSI |
| **WiFi Devices** | Unique WiFi MAC addresses with vendor name and device type |
| **WiFi Assoc** | WiFi probe requests with SSIDs |

### Map View

The map shows a heatmap of detection locations:
- **Red/Orange areas** = Many detections (likely SAR team positions)
- **Blue/Green areas** = Fewer detections (potentially interesting)

Use the layer toggle to switch between BT-only, WiFi-only, or combined view.

---

## WiFi Device Identification

The dashboard automatically identifies WiFi devices using the IEEE OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) database:

- **Vendor**: Manufacturer name looked up from MAC address prefix (e.g., "Apple, Inc", "Cisco Systems")
- **Device Type**: Heuristic guess based on vendor and MAC pattern (e.g., "phone", "network", "iot")

These fields help quickly identify device categories without additional setup. The OUI database contains 38,904 vendor entries and can be updated anytime via the **"Update OUI Database"** button in the sidebar.

---

## Analyst Notes

Both Bluetooth and WiFi device tables include a **Notes** column where analysts can add custom annotations:

- Use notes to flag interesting findings
- Example: "Seen near search zone perimeter"
- Example: "Matches missing person's known networks"
- Notes persist across sessions and appear in exported reports

---

## Understanding Confidence Scores

Each device gets a **confidence score from 0-100** indicating how likely it belongs to a missing person versus SAR team equipment.

### Score Ranges

| Score | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| **70-100** | Possibly missing person's device | Investigate immediately |
| **31-69** | Uncertain origin | Review details |
| **0-30** | Likely SAR team equipment | Lower priority |

### What Affects the Score?

**Lower scores (likely SAR team):**
- Device present throughout entire session
- Strong signal at both session start and end
- Always detected near HQ/staging area
- Seen across multiple search sessions

**Higher scores (possibly target):**
- Device appeared only mid-session
- Brief detection window
- Detected far from HQ location
- Never seen before

### Running Analysis

1. Click the **"Analyze Confidence"** button in the sidebar
2. Review the preview showing proposed score changes
3. Click **"Apply Changes"** to update scores
4. Filter the device list by confidence to focus on high-priority targets

### Enriching WiFi Device Data

The confidence analyzer automatically enriches WiFi device data during analysis:

- Looks up vendor names using IEEE OUI database
- Guesses device type based on vendor patterns
- Stores enrichment results for persistence

Use the **"Update OUI Database"** button to sync the latest vendor data before running analysis.

---

## Managing Team Devices (Whitelist)

To exclude your team's known devices from analysis:

### Adding Devices to Whitelist

Edit the `device_whitelist.txt` file on the scanner:

```text
# SAR Team Equipment
# Add one MAC address per line

# Team Leader phone
AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF

# SAR vehicle tracker
11:22:33:44:55:66

# Drone controller
AA:BB:CC:11:22:33
```

Whitelisted devices automatically receive confidence score = 0.

### Finding Your Device's MAC

- **iPhone**: Settings → General → About → WiFi Address
- **Android**: Settings → About Phone → Status → WiFi MAC Address
- **Bluetooth devices**: Check device packaging or companion app

---

## Field Operations

### Before Deployment

1. **Charge fully** - Scanner runs ~8 hours on 10,000mAh powerbank
2. **Test GPS fix** - Ensure satellites lock before leaving staging area
3. **Update whitelist** - Add all team device MACs
4. **Update OUI database** - Click "Update OUI Database" button for latest vendor data (optional but recommended)
5. **Set HQ coordinates** - Configure staging area location in settings (optional)
6. **Verify web access** - Confirm dashboard loads on your phone/tablet

### During Search

1. **Move steadily** - Walk at normal pace, pausing briefly in key areas
2. **Note signal strength** - Strong signals (> -60 dBm) indicate nearby devices
3. **Watch for mid-session appearances** - New devices appearing during search are interesting
4. **Mark locations** - Note GPS coordinates of significant detections

### Common Detection Scenarios

| Scenario | What It Might Mean |
|----------|-------------------|
| Strong signal, stationary | Device is nearby, possibly stationary person |
| Weak signal, moving | Device at distance, or person moving |
| Device appears then disappears | Person passed through area |
| WiFi probing for home network | Device owner lives at that network location |

### After Search

1. **Run confidence analysis** to score all devices
2. **Export data** for mission report
3. **Clear database** before next mission (optional)
4. **Backup database file** for records

## Filtering and Finding Devices

### By MAC Address

Enter partial MAC in the filter box:
- `AA:BB` finds all MACs starting with AA:BB
- `EE:FF` finds all MACs ending with EE:FF

### By Signal Strength

Use the RSSI slider to focus on:
- **Strong signals (> -60 dBm)**: Devices within ~10 meters
- **Medium signals (-60 to -80 dBm)**: Devices 10-30 meters away
- **Weak signals (< -80 dBm)**: Distant devices, 30+ meters

### By Time

Use the time filter to:
- Remove noisy startup period
- Focus on specific search windows
- Isolate times when interesting activity occurred

### By Confidence

Filter by confidence score to:
- Show only high-confidence (70+) potential targets
- Hide likely SAR equipment (0-30)
