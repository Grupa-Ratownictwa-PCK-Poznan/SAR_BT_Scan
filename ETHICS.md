# Ethical Use Policy – SAR_BT_Scan

## 1. Purpose of This Document

The purpose of this document is to **explicitly define the ethical boundaries** for the development, distribution, and use of the SAR_BT_Scan project.

This project is published as open source **solely because it has the potential to save human lives**.  
It is **not ethically neutral software**, and it must not be treated as a general-purpose tracking or reconnaissance tool.

We recognize that this technology is **dual-use** by nature. This document exists to ensure that:
- its **intended humanitarian purpose is explicit**,
- its **misuse is unambiguously condemned**, and
- no user can credibly claim ignorance regarding what uses are unacceptable.

## 2. What This Project Is (and Is Not)

### What This Project Is
SAR_BT_Scan is a **technical support tool for Search and Rescue (SAR)** operations.  
It passively scans **Bluetooth and Wi-Fi broadcast signals** in order to assist in locating **missing or endangered persons**.

The software:
- does **not** break encryption,
- does **not** intercept communication content,
- does **not** bypass authentication,
- does **not** exploit vulnerabilities.

### What This Project Is Not
This project is **not**:
- a surveillance platform,
- a stalking tool,
- a people-tracking system for routine or private use,
- a law-enforcement shortcut to avoid due process,
- a tool for curiosity-driven or recreational scanning of people.

## 3. Ethical Foundation

The ethical justification for this project rests on **necessity and proportionality**.

Use of this technology is ethically acceptable **only when all of the following are true**:
1. There is a **credible risk to human life or health**, and
2. The person being searched for is **missing, lost, incapacitated, or unable to consent**, and
3. The operation is conducted by, or in cooperation with, a **legitimate rescue organization**, and
4. The use is **limited strictly to the duration and scope of the rescue operation**.

Outside of these conditions, the use of this technology **loses its ethical justification**.

## 4. Explicitly Permitted Use

The following uses are considered ethically legitimate:

- Search and Rescue operations conducted by:
  - police
  - registered SAR groups,
  - fire brigades (OSP / PSP),
  - Red Cross / Red Crescent organizations,
  - mountain, water, or wilderness rescue services.
- Training and testing:
  - conducted by SAR organizations,
  - using test devices or controlled scenarios,
  - without collecting data about uninvolved third parties.

## 5. Prohibited Uses (Zero Tolerance)

Uses contrary to the purpose of this project are **explicitly prohibited**.

### 5.1 Targeting Non-Missing Persons
Using this software to locate, track, profile, or follow **any person who is not officially missing** is prohibited.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- tracking a partner, spouse, or family member,
- locating protesters, activists, journalists, or political opponents,
- identifying individuals at public or private events,
- monitoring employees, neighbors, or passers-by.

### 5.2 Surveillance, Stalking, or Harassment
Any use that contributes to:
- stalking,
- intimidation,
- coercion,
- harassment,
- doxxing,
- invasion of privacy,

is strictly forbidden.

### 5.3 Law Enforcement Use Without Due Process
This project must **not** be used by law enforcement:
- for routine monitoring,
- for intelligence gathering,
- as a substitute for lawful interception procedures,
- to bypass judicial oversight.

## 6. Responsibility of Users and Contributors

By using, modifying, or distributing this software, you accept that:
- **ethical responsibility lies with the user**, not only the author,
- legality alone is **not sufficient justification**,
- “because it is possible” is **not an ethical argument**.

Contributors are expected to:
- avoid features whose primary value is surveillance rather than rescue,
- resist “mission creep” toward tracking and profiling,
- challenge proposals that normalize locating people outside rescue contexts.

## 7. On Open Source and Harm Prevention

This project is open source because:
- openness improves transparency and trust,
- it enables legitimate SAR groups to learn and collaborate,
- withholding knowledge would disproportionately harm those trying to do good.

We explicitly reject the idea that secrecy equals ethics.

At the same time, **openness does not mean moral neutrality**.  
Anyone using this project to harm others acts **against the explicit intent and values** of its authors.

## 8. Final Statement

If you are looking for a tool that might help **bring someone home alive**,  
then you are exactly who this project was created for.

Use it accordingly.
